# UNO
Our Mathematica final project was designed to create the UNO card game. We created a single player mode, where the user plays against the computer and a multiplayer mode where the user can locally play UNO with other people. The UNO card game will allow human players along with a culmination of AI players. The UNO card game can be played by a minimum of 2 players and a maximum of 10 players. The user indicates how many players will be playing and our program deals out that many hands.
